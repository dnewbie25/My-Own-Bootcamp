# Month 1 - React Foundations

I initially planned to strat from scratch, but I already have experience with javascript, HTML, CSS and Python, so I spent the first 2 weeks covering the basics again, being humble and assuming that I didn't know anything. But my project for this month starts from week 3.

It was a good refresher, so for terms of simplicity, I will start my bootcamp in the Week 3, with a project.

# Project

My project for this week consists of a CRUD application, the classic to-do app. This app will be incremental, so over the next few weeks I will use it to improve my coding and learning a few concepts from the improves I will apply.

# What it should have

My basic CRUD app should have:

1. A field to add a task
2. Each task should appear on screen
3. The styling will be done with CSS/Tailwind
